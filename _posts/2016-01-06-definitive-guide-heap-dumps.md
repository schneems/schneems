In this two part series I talk about the in and outs of debugging Ruby memory with heap dumps. The first section covers what a heap dump is, how to get one, and how to analyze it. The second section focuses on getting a heap dump off of a Heroku dyno. We then use that data to debug a production memory problem. These were originally published in December 2015, sorry for the delay in linking. Enjoy!
