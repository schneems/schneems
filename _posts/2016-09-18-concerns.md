When I wrote about good modules and bad modules, I mentioned that an indication of a “bad” module was when it was used to extract code for the sake of code extraction. This usually results in a module that is only being mixed into one class.

When I published the article, I had lots of support from people intimately familiar with the internals of many popular libraries like Active Record, agreeing that such extraction is not helpful and would eventually harm a project. I also had people rise up to defend their use of modules.

This gave me more time to reflect on my views and how I expressed them. I realized that while I casually mentioned some of the problem’s “readability,” “complexity,” and “maintainability,” I didn’t do much to explain why modules made this harder. I took my experience for granted, and readers deserve more.
