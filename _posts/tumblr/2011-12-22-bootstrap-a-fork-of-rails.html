<p>If you want to make a change to Rails, you probably want to test out your change in an existing project. Here is what
    I needed to do to get an example project running on my fork of Rails:</p>

<h2>First: Fork Rails</h2>

<p>Before you can run a custom copy of Rails you&#8217;ll want to make a fork and then clone your fork to your local
    machine.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails"><a
            href="https://github.com/rails/rails">https://github.com/rails/rails</a></a> and click the Fork button.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve got a fork clone it locally:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd documents/projects

$ git clone git@github.com:schneems/rails.git

$ cd rails
</code></pre>

<h2>Next Modify Your Gemfile</h2>

<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got a development copy of Rails locally you&#8217;ll need to modify the Gemfile of your
    existing Rails project that you&#8217;re testing against:</p>

<p>You need to point &#8216;rails&#8217; to your local copy, mine is at
    <code>/Users/schneems/documents/projects/rails</code>, you also need to tell it where to find <code>journey</code>
    and <code>arel</code>, for those I just pointed at the existing repos online.</p>

<p>Here is my full Gemfile:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1511159.js?file=Gemfile"></script>
<p>You may need to run <code>bundle exec rake gem</code> in your Rails copy directory to regenerate gemspec files.</p>

<h2>Run your Local project</h2>

<p>Go into your project directory with the modified Gemfile and run Bundler</p>

<pre><code>bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>Then start your server using</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec rails s
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can try running your changes against your own Rails project.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve never contributed to rails check out the <a
        href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html">Rails contribution Guide</a> or ask
    someone who has. Don&#8217;t forget to make a new branch before you make any changes.</p>

<p>For a great example on contributing to an open source project for the first time, check out <a
        href="https://railscasts.com/episodes/300-contributing-to-open-source">Contributing to Open Source</a>.</p>

<p>If you have problems message me <a href="https://ruby.social/@Schneems">@schneems</a> or check out #rails-contrib on
    IRC freenode, they were very helpful getting me set up. Especially <a
        href="https://twitter.com/nashby_">@nashby_</a> for helping with the Gemfile. Good luck and happy contributing.
