<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again, I&#8217;m teaching a course at the University of Texas, though this time
    i&#8217;m officially an Adjunct Professor!! That means not only are students learning all about Rails, they&#8217;re
    getting credit for it. I&#8217;ve taken the liberty to re-record some of my material and share it. Hopefully
    you&#8217;ll be able to follow along at home.</p>

<p>This first week we focus on databases and won&#8217;t get into Rails until the second week. Skipping around is
    encouraged however if you don&#8217;t understand something please go back and check the previous material.</p>

<h2>About this class, and an Introduction to Why we use Databases</h2>

<p>The first part of this lecture covers the format and content of the course, why we use databases, and how the web is
    structured around data and data storage. It&#8217;s fairly non technical, so feel free to skip if you already know
    how data on say Facebook gets saved when you submit a status update.</p>

<h2>How to Store Data in a database</h2>

<p>This second part of this lecture starts out by designing a fake database in a spreadsheet, explaining why a database
    is NOT like excel, and why we would want to use a database over methods you might be more familiar with. We then
    create a database in PostgreSQL, create tables, insert data, and query it. If you&#8217;re a beginner or have never
    manually manipulated a production quality database this video is for you.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>Thanks for stopping by I&#8217;m hoping to split up the content so that you can zoom into the section you&#8217;re
    interested in without having to go through the whole course. As always if you have questions or comments message me
