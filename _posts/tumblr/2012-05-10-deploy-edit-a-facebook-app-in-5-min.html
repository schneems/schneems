<p>Ever want to write an App that uses the Facebook graph? You could be the next Zynga, Foursquare, or Causes; but first
    you need to create your app. This quick demo shows getting started by <a
        href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/facebook">generating an app through Facebook</a> and then editing
    it. If you&#8217;ve already got a working web app it&#8217;s simple to add Facebook functionality to it, though
    we&#8217;ll save that for another day. What are you waiting for, five minutes from now you could have your very own
    live Facebook App!</p>
