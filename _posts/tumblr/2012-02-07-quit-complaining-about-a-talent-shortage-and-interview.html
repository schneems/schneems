<p>Today a lowly programing peon fails a devious whiteboarding interview torture trap! After candidate leaves, the
    interviewer asks their colleges, &#8220;why are there no good programmers available?&#8221;. Well&#8230;</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve heard two common complaints, first from companies looking to hire not finding talent, and the
    second from programmers looking for new jobs only to find a degrading, demoralizing, and difficult interview process
    (re: <a href="https://twitter.com/bascule">@bascule</a>'s <a
        href="https://www.unlimitednovelty.com/2011/12/can-you-solve-this-problem-for-me-on.html">"Can you solve this
        problem for me on the whiteboard?"</a>). If you don&#8217;t think these two trends have something to do with one
    another, think again.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been interviewing a fair bit since the Gowalla announcement. While I don&#8217;t mind the
    psycho-crazy-double-link-list-recursive-binary-tree-fizz-buzz-sorting-matrix-manipulation&#8212;whiteboard
    questions, they&#8217;re not my favorite. In fact, they&#8217;re no-ones favorite questions. Instead I appreciate
    interviews that focus on the position I&#8217;m applying for and have done adequate research into my background. As
    a general rule of thumb if you&#8217;re an interviewer, don&#8217;t as me a question that you wouldn&#8217;t mind me
    asking you.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: &#8220;Do you have any questions for me?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: &#8220;Yes! Given a singly linked list &#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>If I did that to an interviewer they would think I was joking or be offended. Why would I not think the same?</p>

<p>So we all agree, whiteboarding questions aren&#8217;t the holy grail of interviewing techniques, instead here are a
    few things companies have done that I prefer and feel they gave a greater insight into how I would perform on the
    job.</p>

<h2>Pair Programming</h2>

<p>The first alternative, is pair programming. Pick a <em>real</em> problem, it can be open source, or it can be from
    your code base, as long as the interviewer and the candidate can understand and work on the problem in under an hour
    (or more depending on the length of the interview). Why do I like this method? It shows how I really work, and
    answers quite a few questions about how the company works. We get to have a real conversation about a real problem
    using real programming tools and hopefully do some real work. Doesn&#8217;t that sound great? But there are some
    down sides to this approach. This will require quite a bit more work on the interviewer&#8217;s side to pick a
    problem that is appropriate and short enough. It can also be easy to accidentally allow this technique to degrade
    into &#8220;pair whiteboarding&#8221;, which still misses the point. I think the effort is worth it. If a company
    can&#8217;t take the time to find a decent problem they probably won&#8217;t take the time to help me grow in my
    career.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>My second favorite alternative, is a project. Only two companies I interviewed with asked for projects, though
    I&#8217;ve decided to accept a position with one of them (details coming soon!). Again the project should be related
    to the job at hand and not simply a take-home whiteboarding question. This allows the candidate to use their every
    day tools and resources- hello API docs - to produce code like they would be committing to your repo. It
    doesn&#8217;t even have to be coding based. It could be a presentation on a potential feature, or filing a bug
    report, or anything you want. The downside is the same as above, coming up with a meaningful project is harder then
    regurgitating the same questions we were asked out of college. But it is very rewarding to see someone&#8217;s true
    potential. A word of note, don&#8217;t use this to &#8220;weed&#8221; candidates out, programmers don&#8217;t have
    infinite time and the last thing we want to be doing is doing projects for a company that won&#8217;t follow up with
    us. Time box the project at 1~2hrs if it&#8217;s early on in the process, or more if its later in the interviews and
    you are really serious about the candidate. If you ask for a project first, don&#8217;t do whiteboarding later
    &#8230; that&#8217;s just redundant and disrespectful.</p>

<h2>Brainstorming</h2>

<p>Pick a question that the company has run into in the past or is currently facing and start a brainstorming session.
    Use this to see how the candidate approaches problems and leverages those around them for more information. In this
    scenario you&#8217;re deliverable is not run-able code but a solid understanding of the problem and at least one
    potentially viable solution. Make sure the interviewer isn&#8217;t just grilling the candidate and that it&#8217;s a
    joint session. It&#8217;s easy, it&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s collaborative, and it&#8217;s useful. Feel free to use
    this with any other methods listed.</p>

<h2>Work to Hire</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve never had a company offer this to me. Though I&#8217;ve worked for one that offered it. We gave a
    guaranteed six months full time work with a full-time offer by the 5th month if there was a good fit. It was nice
    for both parties involved because it gave enough time to let the honeymoon period wear off and see if there was a
    mutually beneficial relationship. The upsides are great, &#8220;have your cake and let it go if it doesn&#8217;t
    work for you too&#8221;, but there are some major downsides. Your team will lose productivity bringing new hires up
    to speed, and while this task should become easier over time, hiring a number of people just to let them go, is not
    a great idea. If you have a truly great candidate, you might lose them to a full-time job offer. That being said I
    would rather get a work-to-hire offer from a company then no offer at all.</p>

<h2>Above all Else</h2>

<p><strong>Programmers</strong>: Ask what interview tactics a company uses early on. Suggest an alternative that you
    like from above if they whiteboard. Don&#8217;t be afraid to call out an interviewer on an irrelevant question, or
    at least ask for the motivation behind that question. Having a firm understanding of what the company wants will
    help you put your best foot forward.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewers</strong>: Decide what qualities you&#8217;re looking for before a candidate comes to your
    office. If you care about team culture, leadership abilities, specific programming abilities or skills, then make
    sure the interview process reflects those values. Better yet, be up-front with the candidate. If you&#8217;re a
    large company and you will only accept PHD level fortran programmers, then say so. Also don&#8217;t expect a
    philosophy major with 7+ years of python to give you big O notation of every sort algorithm off the top of their
    head. Expect them to do python. Please read up on a candidates background and ask them specific questions related to
    your values before bringing them in. If you must whiteboard, explain why and what you&#8217;re looking for, be
    honest. Remember everything you do, says something about your company.</p>

<p>Good luck and happy interviewing.</p>
