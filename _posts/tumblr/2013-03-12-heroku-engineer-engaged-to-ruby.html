<p>It was a long day when <a href="https://ruby.social/@Schneems">@schneems</a> typed
    <code>$ git push heroku master</code>, opened his website, and exclaimed <strong>"I love Ruby!"</strong>. Then as if
    inside of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pee-wee's_Playhouse">Pee-wee&#8217;s Playhouse</a> he heard a voice
    say: &#8220;If you love Ruby so much why don&#8217;t you marry her?&#8221;. So on December 25th, he got down on one
    knee with his Grandmother&#8217;s engagement ring and proposed to <a href="https://twitter.com/rubyku">Ruby Ku</a>.
    She said yes!</p>

<p>You might think that to be the end of the story, dear readers, but it&#8217;s just the beginning. Fast forward to
    March, our young protagonist sits weary on a plane bound for Austin, Tx. He&#8217;s been away nearly a month, and
    has the jet lag to prove it. As he descended the airport escalator, destined to touch foot in the city he calls
    home, he heard a strange sound. As he lowered, the sound grew, and one-by-one: faces of his friends appeared at the
    base of the moving steps. As he stepped out he looked for his bride to be, but couldn&#8217;t find her. Then his
    friends part like sea from sky and suddenly&#8230;</p>

<p>Did you watch the video?</p>

<p>How are you still reading? Aren&#8217;t your eyes filled with tears, and you cheeks cramping from smiling? (I know
    mine were).</p>

<p>Ruby steps forward holding cue-card style signs. Then, in-time to the boom-box soundtrack, she drops the cards
    explaining one-by-one why she is in love. As the last card falls she drops to one knee, and with a bottle of 12 year
    old scotch - proposes to Richard (that&#8217;s me). He said yes!</p>

<h2>The Couple</h2>

<p>Richard met Ruby at a meeting of <a href="https://austinonrails.org/">Austin on Rails</a> when she was learning
    enough programming to make <a href="https://hourschool.com">Hourschool.com</a>. After many awkward moments, false
    starts, and months of waiting: he stole a kiss after a midnight social (bike) ride. She launched <a
        href="https://hourschool.com">her company</a>, while <a
        href="https://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/gowalla-confirms-facebook-acquires-location-based-social-network/5808">his
        got devoured by Facebook</a>. They moved in together, he got a <a
        href="https://www.schneems.com/2012/02/22/journey-to-the-center-of-geekdom.html">job at Heroku</a>, her company
    won a design award from <a
        href="https://www.ac4d.com/2012/07/10/alumni-christina-tran-wins-core77-service-award/">core77</a>, and they
    found the light of their life: <a href="https://cl.ly/image/1I373H2x0Y3r">Cinco Dog</a>. She sometimes teaches at <a
        href="https://www.ac4d.com/home/people/students-and-alumni/ruby-ku/">Austin Center for Design</a> and He
    sometimes teaches at the <a href="https://www.schneems.com/ut-rails">University of Texas</a>. They are both
    massively addicted to coffee, sunny days, and dachshund kisses.</p>

<p>After their mutual proposals, Ruby and Richard will be married on an urban farm in Austin, Tx on April 27th, 2013.
    Cinco dog remains single and ready to mingle.</p>

<h2>The Journey Begins</h2>

<p>Tomorrow brings another sunrise, another sunset, and another day of Richard loving Ruby.</p>
