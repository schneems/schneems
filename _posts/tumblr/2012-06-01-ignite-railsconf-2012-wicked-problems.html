<p>I gave this talk on Wicked Problems at Ignite RailsConf 2012. A Wicked Problem is one that is difficult or impossible
    to solve. As Rails people, or Tech people, or web people we tend to focus on the here and now, but we can aspire to
    so much more. Not a very technical topic, but an important one for sure.</p>

<p>This talk was based on the ebook <a href="https://www.wickedproblems.com/">Wicked Problems</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m off in Amsterdam for <a href="https://www.euruko2012.org/">EuRoKu</a> today so if you have comments, shoot
    me a line <a href="https://ruby.social/@Schneems">@schneems</a> and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as the
    conference internet planets align</p>
