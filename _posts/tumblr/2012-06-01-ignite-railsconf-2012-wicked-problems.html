<p>I gave this talk on Wicked Problems at Ignite RailsConf 2012. A Wicked Problem is one that is difficult or impossible to solve. As Rails people, or Tech people, or web people we tend to focus on the here and now, but we can aspire to so much more. Not a very technical topic, but an important one for sure.</p>

<p>This talk was based on the ebook <a href="http://www.wickedproblems.com/">Wicked Problems</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m off in Amsterdam for <a href="http://www.euruko2012.org/">EuRoKu</a> today so if you have comments, shoot me a line <a href="http://twitter.com/schneems">@schneems</a> and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as the conference internet planets align</p>
