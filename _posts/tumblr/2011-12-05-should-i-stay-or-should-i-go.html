<p>Gowalla was acquired by Facebook and I&#8217;m left with a decision of what to do next.</p>

<h2>This post best read while listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/GqH21LEmfbQ">The Clash</a></h2>

<p>Its been a wild and crazy ride at Gowalla, I&#8217;ve enjoyed making some great features and a build a revolutionary product. No mater what happens the band is breaking up, and the curtains are closing in. Some of us are forging towards and will continue to <a href="https://blog.gowalla.com/post/13782997303/gowalla-going-to-facebook">work for Facebook</a> while others are taking the opportunity to explore <a href="https://maxvoltar.com/archive/goodbye-gowalla">new ventures</a>. While I would love nothing more than to continue to work on this product I love, that just isn&#8217;t a possibility.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been asked quite frequently on <a href="https://twitter.com/schneems">twitter</a> about my future plans. And I&#8217;m here to say: It&#8217;s complicated. Being acquired has certainly been good for me but&#8230;</p>

<p>I am not a part of the team being shipped over to Palo Alto and I haven&#8217;t made up my mind about where i&#8217;ll go next. I&#8217;m currently in talks with several companies both in Austin, Tx and in California and I haven&#8217;t yet made that decision.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve grown a lot since I first started at Gowalla, and I just don&#8217;t want to stop now. There are plenty of good problems out there, and I aim to make a good dent in  them. I need to find that next big challenge out there. I&#8217;ll keep everyone posted as I move forward.</p>

<p>Thanks for the good times <a href="https://twitter.com/gowalla">@Gowalla</a> it was fun while it lasted, i can&#8217;t wait to see what new adventures the future brings.</p>
