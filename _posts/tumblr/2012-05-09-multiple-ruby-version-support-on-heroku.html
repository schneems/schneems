<p>Starting today <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> will allow you to <a
    href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-support#ruby_versions">specify a version of Ruby</a> in your
  production app. As one of the most requested features we have been asked for time and time again, we&#8217;re happy to
  announce that it&#8217;s now live. To get started you&#8217;ll want to update your version of Bundler locally to
  version 1.2.0, or above.</p>

  <p>This is a re-post of an Article I wrote for the <a
      href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/5/9/multiple_ruby_version_support_on_heroku/">Heroku Blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>$ gem install bundler --pre
</code></pre>

<p>Then you&#8217;ll want to specify the version of Ruby you want to use in your application inside of your Gemfile. For
  example if we wanted to use Ruby 1.9.3 in our production application you would want to include
  <code>ruby '1.9.3'</code> inside of your Gemfile. In a rails Gemfile it might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>source 'https://rubygems.org'

ruby '1.9.3'
gem  'rails', '3.2.3'
</code></pre>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve added <code>ruby</code> to your Gemfile, commit it to git</p>

<pre><code>$ git add Gemfile
$ git commit -m 'use Ruby 1.9.3 on Heroku'
</code></pre>

<p>Then you&#8217;ll want to deploy your app</p>

<pre><code>$ git push heroku master
</code></pre>

<p>Once your application is done deploying you will be able see the version of Ruby you are using is 1.9.3.</p>

<pre><code>$ heroku run bash
$ ruby -v
ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-linux]
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s that simple!</p>

<p>With this new feature you can also use this process to call a specific version of Ruby other than 1.9.3, however, if
  it is not installed on the Heroku system you&#8217;ll receive an error.</p>

<h2>Production and Development Parity</h2>

<p>At Heroku, we strongly believe that there should always be a strong <a
    href="https://www.12factor.net/dev-prod-parity">parity between development and production environments</a> in order
  to minimize any surprises. When the tooling of your development environment most closely matches your production
  environment, there is far less room for error. Another good example of keeping parity between dev and production
  environments would be running <a href="https://postgresapp.com/">PostgreSQL locally</a> in the development environment
  instead of SQLite since you&#8217;re production system is running <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/">Postgres on
    Heroku</a>.</p>

<p>While there are other reasons you may want to use different versions of Ruby in certain scenarios including
  performance issues or to access version-specific Ruby features, developers should overall strive to use the same tools
  and versions of software for development as are used for production.</p>

<h2>Patch Versions</h2>

<p>While you can now specify the version of Ruby you would like your web application to use, at this time we do not
  support that ability to request a specific patch version to be called, such as Ruby 1.9.2-p290. Ruby patches often
  include important bug and security fixes and are extremely compatible. While you can specify the version of Ruby you
  wish to use, Heroku will provide the most secure patch level of that version.</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;ve followed all the steps above and you&#8217;re still seeing a different version of Ruby than you need,
  please recheck your path.</p>

<pre><code>$ heroku config
PATH     =&gt; vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:bin
RACK_ENV =&gt; production
# ...
</code></pre>

<p>You need to ensure that <code>bin</code> is in front of your path so you could change the above to</p>

<pre><code>$ heroku config:add PATH=bin:vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
</code></pre>

<p>As a tip, It is a good idea to use the free <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases">releases</a>
  feature whenever you are modifying your &#8216;config&#8217; in case you need to roll back to a previous version of
  Ruby.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/hone02">Terence Lee</a> Heroku Ruby team member and bundler maintainer for the
  additional support of ruby versions to the <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby">Heroku Ruby
    Buildpack</a> and orchestrated the release of Bundler 1.2.0. Also thanks to <a
    href="https://twitter.com/#!/wycats">Yehuda Katz</a> and the entire Bundler team for helping get this release out
  the door.</p>

<p>Give this feature a try and let me know what you think <a href="https://ruby.social/@Schneems">@schneems</a>!</p>
