<p>This question comes up a lot, people want to have an object, lets call it a <code>Product</code> that they want to
  create in several different steps. Let&#8217;s say our product has a few fields <code>name</code>, <code>price</code>,
  and <code>category</code> and to have a valid product all these fields must be present.</p>

  <p>This is a re-post of a wiki I wrote for <a
      href="https://github.com/schneems/wicked/wiki/Partial-Validation-of-Active-Record-Objects">Wicked</a>.
    While it was written to be used with a wizard, the pattern can be used without it. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>We want to build an object in several different steps but we can&#8217;t because that object needs validations. Lets
  take a look at our <code>Product</code> model.</p>

<pre><code>class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name, :price, :category, :presence =&gt; true

end
</code></pre>

<p>So we have a product that relies on name, price, and category to all be there. Lets take a look at a simple Wizard
  controller for ProductController.</p>

<pre><code>class ProductController &lt; ApplicationController
  include Wicked::Wizard

  steps :add_name, :add_price, :add_category

  def show
    @product = Product.find(params[:product_id])
    render_wizard
  end


  def update
    @product = Product.find(params[:product_id])
    @product.update_attributes(params[:product])
    render_wizard @product
  end


  def create
    @product = Product.create
    redirect_to wizard_path(steps.first, :product_id =&gt; @product.id)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here the create action won&#8217;t work because our product didn&#8217;t save. OhNo!</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>The best way to build an object incrementally with validations is to save the state of our product in the database
  and use conditional validation. To do this we&#8217;re going to add a <code>status</code> field to our
  <code>Product</code> class.</p>

<pre><code>class ProductStatus &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    add_column :products, :status, :string
  end

  def down
    remove_column :product, :status
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now we want to add an <code>active</code> state to our <code>Product</code> model.</p>

<pre><code>def active?
  status == 'active'
end
</code></pre>

<p>And we can add a conditional validation to our model.</p>

<pre><code>class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name, :price, :category, :presence =&gt; true, :if =&gt; :active?

  def active?
    status == 'active'
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can create our <code>Product</code> and we won&#8217;t have any validation errors, when the time comes that we
  want to release the product into the wild you&#8217;ll want to remember to change the status of our Product on the
  last step.</p>

<pre><code>class ProductController &lt; ApplicationController
  include Wicked::Wizard

  steps :add_name, :add_price, :add_category

  def update
    @product = Product.find(params[:product_id])
    params[:product][:status] = 'active' if step == steps.last
    @product.update_attributes(params[:product])
    render_wizard @product
  end
</code></pre>

<h2>Great, but&#8230;</h2>

<p>So that works well, but what if we want to disallow a user to go to the next step unless they&#8217;ve properly set
  the value before it. We&#8217;ll need to split up or validations to support multiple conditional validations.</p>

<pre><code>class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name,      :presence =&gt; true, :if =&gt; :active_or_name?
  validates :price,     :presence =&gt; true, :if =&gt; :active_or_price?
  validates :category,  :presence =&gt; true, :if =&gt; :active_or_category?

  def active?
    status == 'active'
  end

  def active_or_name?
    status.include?('name') || active?
  end

  def active_or_price?
    status.include?('price') || active?
  end

  def active_or_category?
    status.include?('category') || active?
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>Then in our ProductController Wizard we can set the status to the current step name in in our update.</p>

<pre><code>  def update
    @product = Product.find(params[:product_id])
    params[:product][:status] = step
    params[:product][:status] = 'active' if step == steps.last
    @product.update_attributes(params[:product])
    render_wizard @product
  end
</code></pre>

<p>So on the <code>:add_name</code> step <code>status.include?('name')</code> will be <code>true</code> and our product
  will not save if it isn&#8217;t present. So in the update action of our controller if <code>@product.save</code>
  returns false then the <code>render_wizard @product</code> will direct the user back to the same step
  <code>:add_name</code>. We still set our status to active on the last step since we want all of our validations to
  run.</p>

<h2>Wow that&#8217;s cool, but seems like a bunch of work</h2>

<p>What you&#8217;re trying to do is fairly complicated, we&#8217;re essentially turning our Product model into a state
  machine, and we&#8217;re building it inside of our wizard which is a state machine. Yo dawg, i heard you like state
  machines&#8230; This is a very manual process which gives you, the programmer, as much control as you like.</p>

<h2>Cleaning up</h2>

<p>If you have conditional validation it can be easy to have incomplete Product&#8217;s laying around in your database,
  you should set up a sweeper task using something like Cron, or Heroku&#8217;s scheduler to clean up Product&#8217;s
  that are not complete.</p>

<p><code>lib/tasks/cleanup.rake</code></p>

<pre><code>namespace :cleanup do
  desc "removes stale and inactive products from the database"
  task :products =&gt; :environment do
    # Find all the products older than yesterday, that are not active yet
    stale_products = Product.where("DATE(created_at) &lt; DATE(?)", Date.yesterday).where("status is not 'active'")

    # delete them
    stale_products.map(&amp;:destroy)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>When cleaning up stale data, be very very sure that your query is correct before running the code. You should also be
  backing up your whole database periodically using a tool such as Heroku&#8217;s <a
    href="https://addons.heroku.com/pgbackups">PGBackups</a> incase you accidentally delete incorrect data.</p>

<h2>Wrap it up</h2>

<p>Hope this helps, I&#8217;ll try to do a screencast on this pattern. It will really help if you&#8217;ve had problems
  implementing this, to let me know what they were. Also if you have another method of doing partial model validation
  with a wizard, I&#8217;m interested in that too. As always you can find me on the internet <a
