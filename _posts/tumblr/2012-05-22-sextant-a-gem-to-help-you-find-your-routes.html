<p>News flash, writing a Rails app without knowing your routes is pretty much impossible, and this just in
    <code>$ rake routes</code> takes <strong>forever</strong> [1] to run. So how can we build a Rails site with a
    minimum of time and a maximum of awesome? You can use the recently released <a
        href="https://github.com/schneems/sextant">Sextant</a> Gem [2] to generate routes in your Rails app.</p>

<p>As it turns out if you benchmark the code in <code>$ rake routes</code> it is reasonably fast, the slow part comes
    from having to initialize the app environment every time it&#8217;s run. So lets take some of that code and put it
    in your already initialized web app. What you get is a whole lot of awesome in a tiny package. Next time you want to
    see your routes, just visit <code>/rails/routes</code> in your browser if you&#8217;ve got sextant installed, and
    you&#8217;ll see your routes in no time.</p>

<p>To install add this to your Gemfile:</p>

<pre><code>gem 'sextant'
</code></pre>

<p>Then run <code>bundle install</code> and you&#8217;re good to go. Start your server and visit
    <code>/rails/routes</code></p>

<p>This in-browser information is local only. If you like <a href="https://github.com/schneems/sextant">Sextant</a> tell
    your friends, and tell me <a href="https://ruby.social/@Schneems">@schneems</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>[1] Forever is measured in seconds</li>
    <li>[2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextant">Sextant</a> is an old device for navigating. It can help you
        find your route on a long journey.</li>
</ul>
