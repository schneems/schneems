<p>I wrote this wizard controller library that people seem to really dig called <a href="https://github.com/schneems/wicked">Wicked</a>. It works well to build <a href="https://schneems.com/2012/02/28/wizard-ify-your-rails-controllers-with-wicked.html">after signup wizards</a> and to <a href="https://github.com/schneems/wicked/wiki/Building-Partial-Objects-Step-by-Step">incrementally build objects for the database</a> but there is one thing it didn&#8217;t do very well until now: allow you to change the text in your wizard url&#8217;s quickly and easily.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re new to Internationalization (<a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html">I18n</a>) it&#8217;s a process of making your website look native in more that one language. With the newly released Wicked you can translate your wizard urls or simply use it to change your custom urls in one language with no code changes. Check it out:</p>

<h3>Internationalization of URLS (I18n)</h3>

<p>If your site works in multiple languages, or if you just want more control over how your URL&#8217;s look you can now use I18n with wicked. To do so you need to replace this:</p>

<pre><code>include Wicked::Wizard
</code></pre>

<p>With this:</p>

<pre><code>include Wicked::Wizard::Translated
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow you to specify translation keys instead of literal step names. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve got steps that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>steps :first, :second
</code></pre>

<p>So the urls would be <code>/after_signup/first</code> and <code>/after_signup/second</code>. But you want them to show up differently for different locales. For example someone coming form a Spanish speaking locale should see <code>/after_signup/uno</code> and <code>after_signup/dos</code>.</p>

<p>To internationalize first you need to create your locales files under <code>config/locales</code> such as <code>config/locales/es.yml</code> for Spanish. You then need to add a <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> key under a <code>wicked</code> key like this:</p>

<pre><code>es:
  hello: "hola mundo"
  wicked:
    first: "uno"
    second: "dos"
</code></pre>

<p>It would also be a good idea to create a english version under <code>config/locales/en.yml</code> or your english speaking friends will get errors. If your app already uses I18n you don&#8217;t need to do anything else, if not you will need to make sure that you set the <code>I18n.locale</code> on each request you could do this somewhere like a before filter in your application_controller.rb</p>

<pre><code>before_filter :set_locale

private

def set_locale
  I18n.locale = params[:locale] if params[:locale].present?
end

def default_url_options(options = {})
  {locale: I18n.locale}
end
</code></pre>

<p>For a screencast on setting up and using I18n check out <a href="https://railscasts.com/episodes/138-i18n-revised">Railscasts</a>. You can also read the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html">free I18n Rails Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Now when you visit your controller with the proper locale set your url&#8217;s should be more readable like <code>/after_signup/uno</code> and <code>after_signup/dos</code>.</p>

<p>Wicked expects your files to be named the same as your keys, so when a user visits <code>after_signup/dos</code> with the <code>es</code> locale it will render the <code>second.html.erb</code> file.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> When you do this the value of <code>step</code> as well as
<code>next_step</code> and <code>previous_step</code> and all the values within <code>steps</code> will
be translated to what locale you are using. To translate them to the
&#8220;canonical&#8221; values that you&#8217;ve have in your controller you&#8217;ll need so
use <code>wizard_value</code> method.</p>

<p>For example, if you had this in your controller, and you converted it to
a use Wicked translations, so this will not work:</p>

<pre><code>steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends

def show
  case step
  when :find_friends
    @friends = current_user.find_friends
  end
  render_wizard
end
</code></pre>

<p>Instead you need to use <code>wizard_value</code> to get the &#8220;reverse translation&#8221; in your controller code like this:</p>

<pre><code>steps :confirm_password, :confirm_profile, :find_friends

def show
  case wizard_value(step)
  when :find_friends
    @friends = current_user.find_friends
  end
  render_wizard
end
</code></pre>

<p>The important thing to remember is that <code>step</code> and the values in <code>steps</code> are
always going to be in the same language if you&#8217;re using the Wicked translations.
If you need any values to match the values set directly in your controller,
 or the names of your files (i.e. <code>views/../confirm_password.html.erb</code>, then you need
to use <code>wizard_value</code> method.</p>

<h2>Custom URL&#8217;s</h2>

<p>Very similar to using I18n from above but instead of making new files for different languages, you can stick with one language. Make sure you are using the right module:</p>

<pre><code>include Wicked::Wizard::Translated
</code></pre>

<p>Then you&#8217;ll need to specify translations in your language file. For me, the language I&#8217;m using is english so I can add translations to <code>config/locales/en.yml</code></p>

<pre><code>en:
  hello: "hello world"
  wicked:
    first: "verify_email"
    second: "if_you_are_popular_add_friends"
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can change the values in the URL&#8217;s to whatever you want without changing your controller or your files, just modify your <code>en.yml</code>. If you&#8217;re not using English you can set your default_locale to something other than <code>en</code> in your <code>config/application.rb</code> file.</p>

<p>config.i18n.default_locale = :de</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Don&#8217;t forget to use <code>wizard_value()</code> method to make
sure you are using the right cannonical values of <code>step</code>,
<code>previous_step</code>, <code>next_step</code>, etc. If you are comparing them to non
wicked generate values.</p>

<p>Custom crafted wizard urls: just another way Wicked makes your app a little more saintly.</p>
