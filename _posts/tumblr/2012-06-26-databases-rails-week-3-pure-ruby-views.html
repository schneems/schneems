<p>In <a href="https://www.schneems.com/2012/06/14/databases-rails-week-1-introduction.html">week one</a> we learned
    about storing data and using databases. In <a
        href="https://www.schneems.com/2012/06/20/databases-rails-week-2-modeling-relationships-and.html">week 2</a> we
    saw how we can model relationships with databases, and use those relationships with Ruby and Active Record to build
    models in Rails. This week we start out with a quick <a href="https://youtu.be/5-eWdVsiwgI">Recap of last week</a>
    followed by a <a href="https://gist.github.com/2968840">Quiz</a>. Once you finish the quiz you can check out the <a
        href="https://gist.github.com/2968916">Quiz Solutions</a>.</p>

<p>This week we will be focused on building cool things with Pure Ruby (no Rails). We&#8217;re going to cover some Ruby
    basics, and then dive into an exercise where we build an HTML generator using only Ruby. The students really enjoyed
    the exercise, and got quite a bit out of it, so you shouldn&#8217;t skip it. Even if you&#8217;ve been using rails
    for years, the exercise might give you new insight into how exactly some of that Rails magic works.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll also cover using GIT and you&#8217;ll need that for the <a
        href="https://github.com/schneems/ruby_view_server">exercise</a>. Get ready cause here comes some serious
    learning.</p>

<h2>Week 3 Videos</h2>

<p>Introduction of topics covered:</p>

<p>Using the functions found in Ruby&#8217;s STDlib:</p>

<p>Using the ERB library from Ruby&#8217;s STDlib to generate HTML:</p>

<p>Finally an Introduction to using GIT. We cover the basics of using a source control management software (GIT) as well
    as the mechanics of saving files, adding them to a repo, and committing them. GIT is a valuable skill to have, and
    is needed for the <a href="https://github.com/schneems/ruby_view_server">exercise</a>.</p>

<h2>Week 3 Exercise</h2>

<p>First you need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jGUFpWYm60">Fork and Clone</a> my <a
        href="https://github.com/schneems/ruby_view_server">Generating HTML views with pure Ruby repository</a> . Then
    you can follow along with the exercises in the readme.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about skipping the exercise, don&#8217;t. Programming is a language that you have to learn
    by using it. As always if you get stuck try googling, or posting onto <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>.</p>

<p>The only difference is that I won&#8217;t be grading your work, so don&#8217;t submit a pull request when
    you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>Good luck and happy coding.</p>

<h2>Fin</h2>

<p>Next week we&#8217;ll be putting what we learned about databased backed models and view generation together to start
    building a fully functional app. Stay tuned, subscribe to this <a href="https://www.schneems.com">tumblr blog</a>,
    or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/schneems">youtube channel</a> and let me know if you&#8217;ve got any
