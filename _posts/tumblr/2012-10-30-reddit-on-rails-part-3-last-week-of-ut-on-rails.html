<p>I&#8217;m finally wrapping up my <a href="https://www.schneems.com/ut-rails">UT on Rails</a> series. While people
    have been getting close to the end of the course, I&#8217;ve gotten the question &#8220;Now what?&#8221; plenty of
    times. Now that you&#8217;ve spent 40+ hours pouring over videos, exercises, and quizzes where do you go from here?
    To answer this question I made a short video. But first, the last exercise of the course:</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/schneems/reddit_on_rails/blob/master/part_three.md">Reddit on Rails: Part 3</a></h2>

<p>This week we wrap up our Reddit on Rails exercise series by adding styling to our project, full text search, and some
    much needed integration tests. What are you waiting for go start on
    <a href="https://github.com/schneems/reddit_on_rails/blob/master/part_three.md">the exercise</a>.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/Bj-4NnDVkXA">Where Do We Go Now</a></h2>

<p>A programming course can&#8217;t make you a good programmer, watch this video to learn where to go from here.
    Don&#8217;t stop now, you&#8217;re so close to doing great things&#8230;</p>

    the class might be over, I still talk about Ruby and Rails quite a bit. Thanks, and see you on the internets.</p>
